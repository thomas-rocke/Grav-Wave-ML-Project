# Grav-Wave-ML-Project

## File System
### System
The System subdirectory hosts all of the code required for the project.
### Planning
The Planning subdirectory hosts the code design and documentation. It has a folder structure identical to System, and each code file in System should have its own documentation file under the same filename.
